# SNMPSniper ðŸŒ™

Speedy C++ SNMP Scanner [IN PROGRESS]

SNMPSniper is based on onesixtyone (https://github.com/trailofbits/onesixtyone), i can say that i learned a lot by looking at their code.
If you want to learn how to interact with SNMP using C i would go read their code since it's much simpler than the one here.

I redesigned most of it using the OOP of C++, but there is still a lot of similarities, in what the functions actually does.
